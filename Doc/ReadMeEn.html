<body><span style="font-weight: bold;">Copyright (c) Prolog Development Center SPb</span><br>Author: Viktor Yukhtenko<br><h1>How to build and run WorkSpaceManager</h1>The
WorkSpaceManager application is designed to organize a working
environment that includes many projects and companion files of various
types. <br><br>The application is written in the language of Visual
Prolog v.8. A commercial version of this system is required to compile
and build the project. <br><br>The application is distributed under the GNU GPL v.3 license, that is without restrictions on the application.<br>The application source code is an integral part of the SpbRsolutions v.1.0 source code array. <br>To build executable applications, you need classes from the SpbVipTools toolkit of the same version.<br><h2>Location of executable applications</h2>The
output codes allow you to build two types of applications running on MS
Windows (the operation is tested in Windows 10 environment):<br><ul><li>Mono-application: <span style="font-weight: bold;">WorkSpaceManager.exe</span></li><li>An application consisting of two executable parts - http-client and http-server:</li><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">WSM_http_backend.exe</span></li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> WSM_http_frontend.exe</span></li></ul></ul>All these applications are included in SpbRsolutions and allow you to use them without compiling projects.<br>The mono <span style="font-weight: bold;">WorkSpaceManager.exe</span> is located in the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">SpbRsolutions\SpbVipTools\Bin</span> directory<br><br>Http-Server <span style="font-weight: bold;">WSMbackend.exe</span> is located in the directory <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">SpbRsolutions\SpbProjects\WS_Manager\WSM_http_CS\WSM_http_backend\Exe&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>The Http-Client <span style="font-weight: bold;">WSMfrontend.exe</span> is located in the directory <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">SpbRsolutions\SpbProjects\ WS_Manager\WSM_http_CS\WSM_http_frontend\Exe</span><br><br>Along with these executable applications, all the files are located: they are needed to run them.<br><br>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">WorkSpaceManager.exe</span> application can be started in the usual way,<br><br>Before running the <span style="font-weight: bold;">WSMfrontend.exe</span> application, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">WSMbackend.exe</span> application must be started.<br><br>To get started the WorkSpaceManager (mono or client-server pair), <a href="#RunExe">see below</a>.<br><h2>Source Code Location</h2>The source code is located in the SpbProjects directory, as shown in the figure:<br><p>&nbsp;<img style="width: 174px; height: 169px;" alt="" src="WSM_FileStructure.PNG"></p>The mono project is&nbsp; WorkSpaceManager.vipprj in the SpbRsolutions \ SpbProjects \ WS_Manager \ WSM_Mono directory. <br>The http-Server project is WSMbackend.vipprj in the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpbRsolutions \ SpbProjects \ WS_Manager \ WSM_http_CS \ WSM_http_backend directory. <br>The http Client project is WSMfrontend.vipprj in the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpbRsolutions \ SpbProjects \ WS_Manager \ WSM_http_CS \ WSM_http_frontend directory.<br><h2>Building the WorkSpaceManager.exe application</h2><br>1. Start the Visual Prolog IDE. <br>2. Open the project (Project \ Open) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpbRsolutions \ SpbProjects \ WS_Manager \ WSM_Mono \ WorkSpaceManager.vipprj<br>3. When you open the project for the first time, the IDE will inform you that <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpbProjects <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpbSolutions IDE variables are not defined <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and will prompt them to sequentially determine not essential). <br>4. Set the routes for the IDE variables: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpbProjects to the directory ... SpbRsolutions \ SpbProjects <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpbSolutions to the directory ... SpbRsolutions \ SpbVipTools <br>5. Run the build of the project through the menu Build \ Build or Build \ Rebuild All<br>6.
