<br><small><small>WorkSpace Manager&nbsp;<br>Version 2.0</small></small><h2>Adding and deleting files</h2>The operations of adding and deleting files are performed using the Add File (s) and Manipulate Entity sections.<br><br><img style="width: 241px; height: 99px;" alt="" src="PicturesEn/Add_Delete_Move_Check_File.png"><br><h3>Add file</h3>Files in the group can be added only those that have extensions registered in the properties of the workspace.<br>To add a file to a group:<br><ul><li>Select the target group in the workspace tree. If grouping is not
performed, the root of the tree is selected.</li><li>In the File Editing section, invoke the Add File operation.</li><li>In the dialog that appears, select the directory and file extension.</li></ul><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img style="width: 470px; height: 307px;" alt="" src="PicturesEn/ChooseFile.PNG"> </small><ul><li>Close the dialog with the Open button or cancel the operation.</li><li>If a file has been selected, the added file will appear in the file list of the workspace.</li></ul><h3>Batch file upload</h3>Adding list of files from the selected directory is performed using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add From Folder</span> icon.<br>This
invokes a dialog to select a directory. From the selected directory,
all files with extensions registered in the current workspace are added
to the selected group. Only files whose extensions are selected using
the filter will be visible.<br><h3>Delete file</h3>To delete a file:<br><ul><li>Mark the file and in the control panel activate the Delete File button.</li><li>Confirm the deletion of the file if the operation was not caused by mistake.</li></ul>The selected file can also be deleted with the keyboard <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span> key.<br>To delete a group of files, select the list of files and use either the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete File</span> icon or the keyboard <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span> button.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> deleting files from a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Folder</span> &nbsp;node is not performed (as opposed to a group), deleted files are only marked with their (selected) color.<br><h3>Check for the existence of files</h3>If a file is included in the list of workspace files, but it is not physically present, WSM detects this when:<br><ul><li>loading workspace file data;</li><li>when performing operations on files;</li><li>when using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Check Files</span> icon.</li></ul>In the latter case, the physical existence of the files is checked for the selected node (and all its subnodes).<br>The current version of WSM does not check for the existence of files continuously.</body></html>
